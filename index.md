## Our work and focus:
Hand-crafted and artisanal Audio/Studio exquisites ~ from new products to modded clones of only the best consoles/parts from the 50ies to late 80ies ~ design, manufacture, customization, repair & improvements. We also rent-out gear and experts on T&M basis for tracking, mixing and recording sessions; make sure a dead OpAmp or Capacitor isn't holding up thousands of euros of Studio- and Musicians' Time!
