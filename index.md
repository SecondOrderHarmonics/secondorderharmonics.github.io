Welcome to **secondorderharmonics.com/.eu** &mdash; find out more [about us, our work and passion](/about.html).

1. Customized Clones of Neve, API, EMI, and other famous audio consoles
   (we prefer 500 Series for various reasons, but work with any kind of
   out-board gear and also directly on vintage consoles from many
   brands)
2. Summing: In todays world everyone uses a DAW for recording, even
   Studios with 96 Channel Consoles have ProTools running,
   audio-interfaces with fairly decent specs have become affordable for
   musicians themselves, as have some outboard solutions: Pres, EQs, FX.
    - Without summing and bussing to various 2TRK (two track) outputs,
    it's fairly difficult to work with low-latency outboard gear while
    editing mixes in a DAW or tracking live via a ADC/DAC interface and
    controling it's inputs/faders/impendence settings (e.g. HiZ).
    - Most summimng units on the market are hugely overprized, we have
    no idea why. One of the first units we came up with was a 8 Channel
    to 2xCombo XLR/TRS (Stereo or Mono) outputs that fits in one hand.
    The design has since been open-sourced and the hardware is still
    being updated with newer revisions from time to time. But customers
    are usually asking us for specific requirements - everyone has other
    outboard gear, different audio cards or ADC/DACs from UAD to Lavry,
    from MOTU to Focusrite to Arturia, there are so many on the market,
    you can spend hours just on finding an appropriate ADAT S/MUX
    expander. Summing helps. For some Outputs but especially for Inputs.
    Just like having an external 8-12CH mixer routed to the input of
    your ADC/Audio Interface you can sum the channels of different
    inputs to 2TRK/Main on a Summing Bus. And we feel you shouldn't pay
    thousands of euros for - often passive - products in a nice case.
    - So..customized summers: Want to amplifiy Channel 1-8 but
    not 8-16? Because 1-8 are direct inputs whereas 8-16 come from
    dedicated pre-amps or a mixer? No Problem. Want multiple busses,
    inserts, gain staging, output OpAmps or Transformers? Sure. Talk to
    us.
3.  Amplification: from Mic Pre-amps to Console/Outboard Bus Amps. We
    work on all of it: clones of famous vintage equipment, our own
    designs, mods of existing equipment (old and new, vintage and
    clones). We upgrade to the newest IC OpAmps on the Market with THD+N
    (distortion) lower than 0.00004%. We also work on 'fast' and
    'colored' Discrete OpAmps (DOAs) in API-2520 or JE-990 Pinout.
4.  We support OSHW (Open Source Hardware, usually under a Creative Commons or CERN OHL License) and publish our work on GitHub. This includes all artefacts: Schematics, eCAD files, Gerbers, PnP (Pick&Place), BOM as well as any embedded Firmware Source Code (if relevant) and Documentation. We educate about audio electronics, common misconceptions, good/bad ideas - and are happy about any input you might have to share. Questions to ask or a product we can realize for you & ideally the community in general. Check out our [Github](https://github.com/secondorderharmonics) or get directly in contact with us (see form below).

## Our work and focus
Hand-crafted and artisanal Audio/Studio exquisites ~ from new products to modded clones of only the best consoles/parts from the 50ies to late 80ies ~ design, manufacture, customization, repair & improvements. We also rent-out gear and experts on T&M basis for tracking, mixing and recording sessions; make sure a dead OpAmp or Capacitor isn't holding up thousands of euros of Studio- and Musicians' Time! Need something you can't really find as a product on the market? Or even better: there's a product you'd like but it's missing many options (e.g. inserts, busses, outputs, summing, specific amplification or coloring via tubes, transformers or modular colour modules)? You've come to the right place. Whether it be a modification of an existing outboard unit, re-capping and upgrading old Yamaha, Soundcraft, Tascam (Indeed it's rare, but we also do repair, upgrades and mods on vintage Neve, EMI and API originals!). 


### Summing and Compression:
We specialize in Summing and Busses of Consoles among microphone
pre-amps, EQs and above everything else: Compression! of every kind. Be
it Vari-Mu (aka Tube), VCA, FET, Diode-Bridge (e.g. Neve 33609), PWM (Py), 
FET (1173) or Opto (LA2A..3A & many others, old and new) ~ compressors
have become an obession for us. Along with mastering EQs they've had the
biggest impact on sound quality, tracking depth and thickness and
clarity of sound without loss in quality.
