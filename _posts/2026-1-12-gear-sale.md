title: Selling some of our rental, R&D and production gear
description: "synths, 500 units, racked studer pre/eq strips and more"
---

We currently have a lot of studio and production gear to sell at the moment! We need to make space for new projects, get a bigger R&D budget for upcoming projects on the side and thought about selling most of these units for a while now (if they weren't already up on local platforms for some time like the 500 chassis), and now put everything we want to part ways with at the moment - even if it hurts a bit - on the relevant platforms.


## For sale:

- ASM Hydrasynth Desktop in almost new condition
- Studer 963 2x Mono Mic/Line Preamp & EQ as racked channel-strips in custom wood case (cleaned, refurbed, overhauled and circuit checked with Osci and MM)
- Eylsia Karacter 500 Series Stereo Saturator with original packaging, used only twice in a rack, like new.
- 2x Fredenstein Bento 10S Chassis for 500 Series: 10-Slot Chassis with internal PSU. One with studio labeling stickers on it (easily removed), one with some rack burn from a touring case on the front panel (which made some of the LED writing less intelligable but works fine) - both cleaned, tested. One used to be rented out, the other one used to be one of our personal testing units and is in very good condition.
